# Disease Monitoring System - Laravel

## Introduction

The Disease Monitoring System is a web application developed using Laravel, designed to track and monitor the spread of diseases in real-time. Users can report symptoms, their locations, and other disease-related data. This data is stored in Firebase, enabling real-time updates and easy access for administrators to track and analyze disease trends.

The app includes features like user registration, disease reporting, symptom tracking, and location monitoring. All data is managed using Firebase as the backend, including authentication and Firestore database.
